CALL THIS NODE FLIPPING NOTE OR THRESHOLD SIR

This is to find the threshold for each bucket of Tweet.
We hope to say, "for trump's foreign policy tweets, the threshold was 3", "for trump's MAGA tweets, the threshold was 6"
-can make a histogram or a pie chart

Run the following code on all the tweets, following the same 100 randomly selected users
	To calculate a threshold:
		-random sample 100 users that responded to trump
		-for each user in the 100 users
			-get the people they are following
				-count how many of the people they are following that responded to trump by checking if their user id is in the database
	-using the count, create a "threshold" that makes the claim "people were more likely to respond to trump if the number of the people they follow >= threshold"
